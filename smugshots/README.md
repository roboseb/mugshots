Happy 420! First devlog but I've been working on this for a few days now. Most of the basic functionality is there, but I need to find a way to automatically read the crime on a criminal's page. Not the easiest due to the different formatting used.

Time is running out to get this project done in time. Maybe three days left. Not really sure how much time I'll have on those days.

Been a minute. I had put this project aside to prioritize other things. The core is here, so the rest of the work needed shouldn't be too complicated. Time will tell.

First step is to figure out a way to process the different formats that crimes can show up in. Images and names are generally not an issue.
