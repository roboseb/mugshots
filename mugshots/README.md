God it feels good to not be working with any frameworks or anything like that. I've been working with Godot recently, and I think that since the API I'm using is pretty simple, I may make this a second time rendered with Godot but hosted online as practice.

I guess the project needs an explanation. My girlfriend saw a mugshot game online where you match the crime to the mugshot. That game is essentially updated with a new edition each week, but it also doesn't work on mobile at all, which is where we play games like this. I thought it would be pretty trivial to find some API with mugshot/crime info, and then make a little procedural game. 

The first API I found that I thought would work seems to have been broken for several years. The second was the mugshots-client by agaricide, which I was struggling to setup. Not sure if it also doesn't work, or would maybe be impractical because of its webscraping or however it works. The third I found is the current version using the FBI wanted API. It works pretty well, has a lot of info and criminals and took 2 seconds to connect with. I'm pretty happy.
